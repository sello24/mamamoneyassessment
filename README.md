SpringBoot USSD REST Service assessment


This project simulates a USSD interaction. The project was written in Java 8 and the framework used is SpringBoot.
The test file is in the test folder. The file needs to be imported into SOAPUI such that the interaction can be simulated.
Before executing the test, the REST application needs to be executed such that it is available on the server which you are executing it, in my case was Local.
